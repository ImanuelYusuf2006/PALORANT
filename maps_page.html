          <h2>Urban Warfare</h2>
          <p>
            Once a bustling business district, filled with skyscrapers and busy streets, this area has suddenly become a battlefield. Bombings and gunfire have leveled most of the buildings, leaving only rubble and burned-out vehicles in the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, two military groups battle for control of the remains of the city. The red team seeks to destroy the remaining communications facilities, while the blue team fights to hold this area as their last supply line.
          </p>
          <p>
            With narrow alleys for ambushes, crumbling buildings that can serve as vantage points, and open streets that serve as danger zones, Urban Warfare is a brutal battleground where strategy and quick reflexes determine victory.

          <h2>Rust District</h2>
          <p>
                This industrial complex was once the largest manufacturing center in the city. However, after a long civil war, the factory was abandoned and became a war zone for rebel groups and special forces. Now, the red team and the blue team fight for control of the site, either to destroy the remnants of old technology or to secure the area as a new base of operations.

          <h2>Temple of the Lost</h2>
          <p>
            Hidden deep within the dense jungle, the ruins of this ancient temple have long been a mystery. It is said to hold valuable relics from a lost civilization. But recently, a group of mercenaries and special forces have been battling for control.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red team wants to blow up the main entrance to block access to the artifacts, while the blue team seeks to maintain the temple as a place of historical research. With narrow paths through the trees, fragile suspension bridges, and secret tunnels underground, the Temple of the Lost is a battlefield full of traps and surprise attacks.
